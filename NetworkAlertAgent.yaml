          Instructions: |
            Step 1: Run the skill `FalsePositiveDetector` to determine if the alert is a false positive.

            Step 2: Run the skill `IPTrustClassifier.IPTrustClassifier` using the `src_ip` to classify the trust level of the source IP.

            Step 3: Step 3: Run the skill `RuleRecommender` using all alert details, the false positive result, and the IP classification.
            The skill should return a firewall rule recommendation in a structured format that includes the following fields:
            - rule_name
            - direction
            - access
            - protocol
            - source
            - destination
            - port

            Step 4: If a rule is recommended and the necessary fields are present, call the skill `FirewallRulePatcher.ApplyFirewallRule` using:
            - `nsg_name` from the original agent input
            - all other values from the structured recommendation output of `RuleRecommender`

            Finally, consolidate and summarize the results:
            - False positive analysis
            - IP trust classification
            - Firewall rule recommendation
            - Whether a rule was applied using FirewallRulePatcher
